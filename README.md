# Welcome
Welcome to my first GitHub Pages site. 
I've been using GitHub to accomplish work-related tasks for a few years and decided to try it for personal projects.
I have always liked the workflow on Github so it feels like a natural fit for building more of these sites.

## Theme 

I forked the [Flexible Jekyll](https://github.com/artemsheludko/flexible-jekyll) theme from @artemsheludko 

## Thank you for stopping by!
