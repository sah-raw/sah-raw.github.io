The New Models Codex Y2K20 is a book produced by members of the New Models Discord server, detailing the events that unfolded during 2020. What began as an idea to create a sort of ‘yearbook’ specifically for the members of the server—a concise PDF or slide deck documenting the highlights of what felt like a paradigm-shifting year—turned into a 350+ page book. It included a poster and sticker pack, all designed, edited, and shipped by a core group of server members.
