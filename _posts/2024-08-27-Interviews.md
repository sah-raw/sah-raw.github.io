I have recorded several podcast and video interviews pertaining to my work as a funeral director over the years. The following is a collection of some of the recent interviews I have done:

## PBS Voices: Dead and Buried
:eyes: [Why This Nature Preserve Is Also A Cemetery](https://youtu.be/TqKA8HNEgIE?si=B2r8ZjKpeoX892Ez)

PBS Voices produced a short Youtube webseries looking at how the younger generations are thinking about and dealing with death. They reached out to my cemetery to film an episode about the rise in interest around natural burial. I was particularly excited for the chance to speak to a younger audience about the practice and was moved by the stories shared by other participants of the doc. 
Getting to spend time with Curly Velasquez and the smart production crew at Electric Pearl Productions was also a highlight!

## Texas Overture Podcast
:speaker: [Conservation Burial with Campo de Estrellas](https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/texas-overture/episodes/Conservation-Burial-with-Campo-de-Estrellas-e29eg4f)

Texas Overture is a para-anthropology podcast produced and hosted by writer Camille Sauers and artist Faith Fisher. From their outpost in San Antonio, they cover a range of metaphysical Texas topics and occult personalities like Aline B. Carter's observatory school, balneotherapy, and outsider artist Forrest Bess. 
It was an honor to be included in their lineup, even though I couldn't answer 'yes' when they asked if I've ever had a paranormal experience when working as funeral director. I just don't think spirits are interested in communicating with bureaucratic death workers! Their business is elsewhere.

## Death in the Afternoon
:speaker: [Opening a New Green Burial Cemetery](https://deathintheafternoon.libsyn.com/its-not-easy-being-green-cemetery-edition)
![Death in the Afternoon]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/OGD_PodcastArtwork_Final.jpg)
Death in the Afternoon is a podcast hosted by the funeral director, author and Ask a Mortician Youtube creator, Caitlin Doughty. In this episode, we explore the challenges of opening a green burial cemetery. I share my experience opening Campo de Estrellas. 
Speaking with Caitlin is always a pleasure. We've collaborated in the past, when I contributed a series of essay exploring the similar topic of [what it takes to open your own funeral home.] (https://www.orderofthegooddeath.com/article/american-funeral-home-revolution-5-how-the-other-half-dies/)
